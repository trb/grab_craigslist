# Craigslist Feature Extractor

This app is part of my machine learning workflow for classifing apartment postings to Craigslist. It downloads a hard-coded page listing apartments and extracts features from the found postings. The features currently extracted are price, latitude, longitude, number of images and length of titles. The output is in csv-format to stdout.

## Why?

Wanted to learn Java and needed something to regularly download the Craigslist apartment listing frontpage for my apartment classifier.
